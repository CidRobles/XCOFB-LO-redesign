    <h1>Help Your Neighbors Facing Hunger </h1>
    <p>Across Connecticut too many people are experiencing food insecurity. No parent should have to choose between
        paying their bills and providing food for their child. No senior should have to choose between having heat and
        eating dinner. <strong>Every $1 you give today will make an immediate impact in the lives of your neighbors
            throughout
            Connecticut. Thank you for supporting our vision of a thriving community free of hunger.</strong></p>
